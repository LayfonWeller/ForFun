It's  making a compile time array of all fibonaci
numbers that fits with a value type.
And with consttime hashing and run time hashing
to decide via a switch, what type to get the list
all fibonaci.

If you comment out the actual printing (via the
copy) then you can notice that the arrays are not
stored in program anymore.

# Warning
This test seems to need a very modern compiler.
at the moment it requires GCC trunk.
Other compilers doesn't seem to work.
